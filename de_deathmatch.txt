Deathmatch!!!

Terrorists have infiltrated the college grounds threatening to
blow it up if their demands are not met. They want immediate release 
of extremist leader Dr. Zakir Qureshi, leader of the Islamic Union of 
Central India (IUCI). A group of army personnel led by Captain Tapan Tope
have strict orders to execute each of IUCI's men before they detonate the bomb.

Terrorists : Execute all counter-terrorists or locate the bomb site inside the 
building and blow it up. 

Counter-terrorists : Exterminate all terrorists and secure the building. If a bomb
has been planted, then defuse it.

Cheers!!!!!!
