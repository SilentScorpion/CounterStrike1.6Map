Terrorists have infiltrated the college grounds an hold 8 hostages.
They are demanding the immediate release of extremist leader Dr. Zakir Qureshi,

have strict orders to execute each of the terrorists men before they detonate the bomb.
Terrorists : Execute all counter-terrorists or locate the bomb site inside the 
building and blow it up. 

Counter-terrorists : There are 8 hostages inside the building. Secure them and exterminate
