# Counter Strike 1.6 Map

This is my first attempt at Map making. Starting off creating maps/levels for counter-Strike 1.6 using Valve Hammer Editor (Ver 3.1) provided in the Source SDK.  Valve Hammer Editor is a tool primarily used for developing the architectural background of the level, object placement, texture-mapping, lighting, and the object interaction with the player entity.

de_deathmatch - This version has the classic deathmatch scenario between counter-terrorists and terrorists. Terrorists have to find the bomb site inside the building and plant the bomb. Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists and/or defuse the bomb before it goes off.

cs_dept_hostage - Hostage rescue. Inside the building, there are 8 hostages that need to be rescued by the counter-terrorists.

IMP!!!

This map can be played in both Counter-Strike 1.6 as well as in Counter-Strike:CZ. I tried to run it in CS:Source, but it needs to be converted completely. The textures have to be changed, the entities and models are different. And so, I scrapped it. 

This map is tested on both 1.6 and CZ, and it runs fine. Lowest fps recorded is 26 fps which should be fine with all latest PCs.

To run the map:

1. Copy the .bsp, .nav and .txt files in the ‘maps’ folder of your counter-strike game folder. Ideally, it’s location is …\Valve\Counter-Strike\cstrike\maps

(my location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Valve\Counter-Strike\cstrike\maps)

2. Open your CS Game and PLAY!
